2018 UIOWA hackathon. Finished with 20 hours. No changes to the code made since.

Website:
https://usocialplus.herokuapp.com/

Objective: This website is a place for college students who want to find local students to go to local events together, or find travel companions to travel together. 

4 pages: home, local events, travel posts, and travel post details. You can register and login as a new user, the website uses cache to keep track of the user login info. You can post new local events, or new travel posts.

A small bug: On find travel pals page, you have to click the space between the user's profile picture/username and their description to go to the travel post page, or else there will be an error.

What should be added:
- Design algorithms so that in the main page the website will push what the user might be interested in to the user.
- List all local events on a local events page so that students can directly browse through

Possible bugs fixes and miscellaneous improvements:
1. Parse the user image so that it matches the overall layout.
2. Fix the bug mentioned above.
3. Uses session to keep track of user's login activity, hash the user's password. 
4. User can post comments to other users' posts.
