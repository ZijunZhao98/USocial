2018 UIOWA hackathon. Finished with 20 hours. No changes to the code made since.

Website:
https://usocialplus.herokuapp.com/

4 pages: home, local events, travel posts, and travel post details. You can register and login as a new user, the website uses cache to keep track of the user login info. You can post new local events, or new travel posts.

A small bug: On find travel pals page, you have to click the space between the user's profile picture/username and their description to go to the travel post page, or else there will be an error.

Possible improvements:
1. Parse the user image so that it matches the overall layout.
2. Fix the bug mentioned above.
3. Uses session to keep track of user's login activity, hash the user's password. 
4. User can post comments to other users' posts.
